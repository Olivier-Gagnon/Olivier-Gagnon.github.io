I am a PhD candidate in Economics at McGill University, currently on the job market.

My research focuses on labor economics, studying the impact of mass layoffs on worker outcomes using administrative data. I examine how displacement effects vary among immigrants, and more broadly investigate how displacement affects geographic mobility and whether movers experience different labor market outcomes. I am also interested in self-selection in STEM careers, specifically why STEM graduates work in occupations unrelated to their field of study, and how self-selection and other key mechanisms affect the effectiveness of policies addressing STEM worker shortages.

You can find my CV [here](files/cv_og_2.pdf).
