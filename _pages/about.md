This is my website. I am a phd candaite from mcgill university currently on the job market. My interest in research is labor economics where i use adminstsaritive data to study how job displacement affect immigrants and how displaced worker respond to this shock along geographical mobility and industry mobility. I am also interested in self-selection in thje labor market accross occupation and how understanding its determinant, limitation and friction can help us draw policy to help worker shortage in STEM
