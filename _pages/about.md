I am a PhD candidate in Economics at McGill University, currently on the job market.

My research focuses on labor economics, where I use administrative data to examine how job displacement affects immigrants and how displaced workers respond through geographical and industry mobility. I am also interested in self-selection in the labor market and how it affects the effectiveness of policies to address worker shortages in STEM fields.

You can find my CV [here].
