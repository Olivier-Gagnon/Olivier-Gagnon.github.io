I am a PhD candidate in Economics at McGill University, and I will be entering the job market in the 2025-2026 academic year.

My main research focuses on labor economics. My job market paper measures how the effect of job loss varies among immigrants as a function of the time spent in the host country. In another paper, I investigate how displacement affects the geographical mobility of workers and whether movers experience different labor market outcomes. I am also interested in self-selection in STEM careers. Specifically, why STEM graduates work in occupations unrelated to their field of study, and how self-selection and other key mechanisms affect the effectiveness of policies addressing STEM worker shortages.

You can find my CV [here](files/cv_og_2.pdf).
